Since the day that I heard your beautiful voice I was mesmerized, almost in a trance.  
I have fallen head over heels for an angel that has come to this world, and every second, every minute my heart longed for your touch, yearning to be closer to you because my heart knew that you were my soulmate and that we were destined to be together.  
You're perfect in every way and I’ve found myself falling for you more and more as time passed.  
You're the love of my life, Raneem, and I hope I can make you as happy as you make me.  
I love you, darling.
